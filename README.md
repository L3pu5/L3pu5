# 🐰 L3Pu5 🐰 

I'm interested in CyberSecurity, Penetration testing, and programming at various levels. 

My side projects and passion projects involve writing compilers/interpreters, writting command line tools, and playing with data. 

## Active Projects

I am currently building a closed-source programming Language (Squeak) that compiles to x86 assembly for the Windows operating system.
Using my language I am building a C2 agent (King) for integration with MythicC2.
